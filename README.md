# FiveLetterWordGame
A fun 5-letter word guessing game made in C++ for practicing purposes. Guess the randomly selected word to win!

Rules are simple:
1. Your guess has to be 5 letters since the mystery word is also 5 letters.
2. Non-real words or just words simply not in the word database (theres over 5000 words but some might not be in there) will not count and you will have to make a different guess.
3. If your guess has a letter contained in the mystery word that is +1 point but if that letter is in the same position as the letter in the mystery word then it's +2 points
4. If you get 10 points or in other words guessed the word then you win and you can either quit or try another word.
